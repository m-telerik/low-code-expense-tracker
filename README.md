# Cashie: A Low-Code Telegram Bot for Multi-Currency Expense Tracking

**Author:**Â Mari Naumenko  
**Project Type:**Â A solo-developed, production-ready product showcasing the power of low-code/no-code tools and AI-assisted development.

**TL;DR:**Â This repository contains a subset of n8n workflows from my pet project, Cashie â€” a Telegram bot that logs income/expenses in any currency while conversing with users in their native "base" currency. It serves as a concrete example of my ability to design, build, and maintain complex automations as aÂ **Low-Code Engineer**.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Goal

To solve the personal pain point of tracking expenses while fifth immigration and dealing with multiple currencies, using an accessible interface (Telegram) and a powerful low-code backend (n8n).

## ðŸ“Š Architecture


> [!warning]
> This high-level overview focuses specifically on the Router â†’ Media â†’ Help workflow chain. The full Cashie architecture includes additional specialized micro-workflows for:
> - **Transaction Processing**Â with automatic currency conversion at database level and AI-powered categorization
> - **User Analytics & Spending Insights**Â with personalized reports and trend analysis
> - **Error Handling & Ops Agent**Â for 24/7 system monitoring and automatic alerting
> - **User Onboarding & Education**Â with interactive setup flows
> - **Message Localization**Â supporting multiple languages and regional formats

The system is built around n8n as the core orchestration layer. It handles incoming webhooks from the Telegram Bot API, routes requests to specialized sub-workflows, and interacts with a Supabase PostgreSQL database for persistence. AI services (OpenAI, Gemini) are integrated for processing unstructured data like voice messages and receipt images.

### ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Highlights

**Scalability & Maintenance:**

- **Modular Design:**Â Each workflow handles specific domain logic, making maintenance and updates straightforward
- **Centralized Error Handling:**Â Dedicated error workflow ensures consistent issue tracking and user notifications
- **Database Optimization:**Â Efficient PostgreSQL queries with proper indexing for user data and chat memory

**AI/ML Integration Strategy:**

- **Cost-Effective Model Selection:**Â Uses GPT-4o-mini for routing vs. GPT-4o for complex agent tasks
- **Multi-Vendor Approach:**Â Leverages best-in-class services (OpenAI for voice, Gemini for OCR) rather than single-vendor lock-in
- **Intelligent Caching:**Â PostgreSQL memory reduces redundant AI calls for repeated user queries

**User Experience Focus:**

- **Progressive Enhancement:**Â Basic features available for all users, advanced media processing for Pro subscribers
- **Multi-language Support:**Â Automatic language detection and consistent localization across all workflows
- **Graceful Degradation:**Â Clear error messages and alternative actions when features are unavailable

## ðŸŽ¯ Workflows

![[Screenshot 2025-10-27 at 5.17.35 PM.png]]
### 1. Router (`01-router.json`)

**Primary Function:**Â The central nervous system of the bot. It authenticates users, checks their registration status, and intelligently routes incoming messages (text, voice, photo) to the appropriate specialized workflow.

**N8N & Technical Stack:**Â `Switch`Â node,Â `Postgres`Â node,Â `Code`Â node (JS),Â `Merge`Â node,Â `Text Classifier`Â (AI).

**Key Features:**

- User authentication and profile validation via SQL query.
- Input-type based routing (e.g.,Â `photo`Â -> Media workflow,Â `voice`Â -> Media workflow).
- AI-powered intent classification for text messages to distinguish between transactions, reports, and help requests.
- Seamless handoff to sub-workflows while maintaining user context.

**Directly Relevant to Job Requirements:**

- **`SQL`**: Used in theÂ `check-registration`Â node to query theÂ `profiles`Â table.
- **`JavaScript`**: Custom logic in theÂ `to-memory-format`Â node for data normalization.
- **`REST API`**: Communicates with the Telegram Bot API and internal workflow webhooks.
- **`Analytical & Problem-Solving`**: Designed the entire routing logic to ensure scalability and clear separation of concerns.
